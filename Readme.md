# Movielist

A movie watchlist application built using [AureliaJS](https://aurelia.io/). This is accompanying source code for the Auth0 tutorial: [Building a Movie Listing Application with Aurelia and TypeScript](https://auth0.com/blog/building-a-movie-listing-application-with-aurelia-and-typescript).

## Building the application

To compile assets and build the application, run the following from a terminal window inside the project directory:

`au build`

## Running the application

To run the application, run the following from a terminal window inside the project directory:

`au run --watch`

The application will then be available (by default) at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
